NONPARAMETRIC STATS
Robust Statistics

Robust statistics are statistics with good performance for data drawn from a wide range of probability distributions, especially for distributions that are not normal. Robust statistical methods have been developed for many common problems, such as estimating location, scale and regression parameters. One motivation is to produce statistical methods that are not unduly affected by outliers.

Another motivation is to provide methods with good performance when there are small departures from parametric distributions. For example, robust methods work well for mixtures of two normal distributions with different standard-deviations, for example, one and three; under this model, non-robust methods like a t-test work badly.

Non-parametric methods
Use of non-parametric and distribution-free significance tests for paired and unpaired data: sign test, Wilcoxon rank sum test (Mann-Whitney U test), Wilcoxon signed-rank test.


\subsection*{Robust Statistics}

Robust statistics provides an alternative approach to standard statistical methods, such as those for estimating location, scale and regression parameters. 


The motivation is to produce estimators that are not unduly affected by small departures from the model assumptions under which these standard methods are usually derived: the standard methods are comparatively badly affected.


Examples of robust and non-robust statistics

 -The median is a robust measure of central tendency, while the mean is not; for instance, the median has a breakdown point of 50%, while the mean has a breakdown point of 0% (a single large sample can throw it off).

 -The median absolute deviation and interquartile range are robust measures of statistical dispersion, while the standard deviation and range are not.

Trimmed estimators and Winsorised estimators are general methods to make statistics more robust. M-estimators are a general class of robust statistics.

Non Parametrics Tests


Wilcoxon Test 


(corresponds to paired t-test) 


Null: median difference is zero

Alt: Median difference is not zero


Mann Whitney U Test

Assess equivalence between two independent samples.
